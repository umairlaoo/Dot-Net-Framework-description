C# 2.0 (2005): C# 2.0 introduced a number of new features, including generics, anonymous methods, and iterators. It also made it easier to write asynchronous code.
C# 3.0 (2007): C# 3.0 introduced even more new features, including lambda expressions, extension methods, and query expressions. It also made it easier to work with XML and data.
C# 4.0 (2010): C# 4.0 introduced nullable types, dynamic types, and attributes. It also made it easier to work with Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and Windows Communication Foundation (WCF).
C# 5.0 (2012): C# 5.0 introduced type inference, which allows you to omit the type of a variable when it can be inferred from its initializer. It also made it easier to work with asynchronous code.
C# 6.0 (2015): C# 6.0 introduced a number of new features, including string interpolation, global using directives, and file-scoped namespace declarations. It also made it easier to work with records and tuples.
C# 7.0 (2017): C# 7.0 introduced a number of new features, including pattern matching, nested functions, and immutable types. It also made it easier to work with nullable reference types.
C# 8.0 (2019): C# 8.0 introduced a number of new features, including local functions, init only properties, and the using statement for asynchronous operations. It also made it easier to work with generics and reflection.
C# 9.0 (2022): C# 9.0 introduced a number of new features, including record structs, interpolated string handlers, and the global using directive for namespaces. It also made it easier to work with pattern matching and nullable reference types.
C# 10.0 (2022): C# 10.0 introduced a number of new features, including file-scoped namespace declarations, extended property patterns, and lambda expression improvements. It also made it easier to work with strings and arrays.
The current stable version of C# is C# 11.0, which was released in November 2022. It introduces a number of new features, including pattern matching improvements, record struct improvements, and the caller argument expression attribute.

C# is a powerful and versatile programming language that is used to develop a wide variety of applications. It is a good choice for both beginners and experienced developers.
